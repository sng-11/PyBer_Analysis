# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis
Our client, PyBer, is a ride-sharing company that would like to investigate trends in ride-sharing among different city types. This project uses Pandas and Matplotlib to summarize key data from the source and present such data in an understandable and efficient way. The analysis will be useful for PyBer's plan to address disparities among rural, suburban, and urban cities.
