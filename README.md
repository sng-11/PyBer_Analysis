# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis
Our client, PyBer, is a ride-sharing company that would like to investigate trends in ride-sharing among different city types. This project uses Pandas and Matplotlib to summarize key data from the source and present such data in an understandable and efficient way. The analysis will be useful for PyBer's plan to address disparities among rural, suburban, and urban cities.

## Results

_Summary Data by City Types:_

Based on the above table, it is apparent that the the number of total rides and the number of total drivers are both directly proportional to the population density of the city. I.e. urban cities, with more people, will have more drivers and a subsequent greater demand and supply of rides. Also, the average fare per ride and per driver are inversely proportional to the population density of the city. This indicates that the more rides there are, the cheaper the fares will be.

_Multi-line Chart of Total Fares for Each City Type:_

The above line chart shows how the total fare changes in the months of Jan to Apr 2019, among the different city types. Overall, the movement into the spring months do see a slight increase but otherwise the fares remain fairly consistent. The clear trend on this chart supports the data from the previous summary: total fares amount is directly proportional to population density of the city.

## Summary

Based on the above data analysis, there are three recommendations to be made to the CEO of PyBer to address disparities among city types:
1. Increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities: this will increase the supply of rides which can lower fares. This can be done by increasing recruitment initiatives for drivers and offer people more incentive to drive for PyBer.
2. Lower the fares per ride in rural and suburban cities: this will make PyBer rides more affordable to cities with lower populations and increase demand for rides.
3. Increase the number of rides in rural and suburban cities: this can be done by lowering fares but can also be done by increasing advertisement of PyBer in these lower population cities. Also can implement incentives for riders to use the company more often, like gift cards.
