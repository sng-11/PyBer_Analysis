# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose of the Analysis
Our client, PyBer, is a ride-sharing company that would like to investigate trends in ride-sharing among different city types. This project uses Pandas and Matplotlib to summarize key data from the source and present such data in an understandable and efficient way. The analysis will be useful for PyBer's plan to address disparities among rural, suburban, and urban cities.

## Results

_Summary Data by City Types:_

Based on the above table, it is apparent that the the number of total rides and the number of total drivers are both directly proportional to the population density of the city. I.e. urban cities, with more people, will have more drivers and a subsequent greater demand and supply of rides. Also, the average fare per ride and per driver are inversely proportional to the population density of the city. This indicates that the more rides there are, the cheaper the fares will be.

## Summary

Based on the above data analysis, there are three recommendations to be made to the CEO of PyBer to address disparities among city types:
1. Increase the number of drivers in rural and suburban cities: this will increase the supply of rides which can lower fares. This can be done by increasing recruitment initiatives for drivers and offer people more incentive to drive for PyBer.
2. Lower the fares per ride in rural and suburban cities: this will make PyBer rides more affordable to cities with lower populations and increase demand for rides.
3.
